# Go (golang)

* Strong (type of a variable cannot change over time) and statically typed (all
those variables have to be defined at compiled time)
* Excellent community
* Key features
    - Simplicity (easy to learn)
    - Fast compile time (code fast, compile fast, run fast, build fast, test it and get feedback as quick as possible)
    - Garbage collected (memory management, no need to worry about memory allocation go will manage that)
    - Built-in concurrency (concurrency is not parallelism, concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once, parallelism is about doing lots of things at once)
    - Compile to standalone binaries (no need to install anything on the server, just copy the binary and run it)

GO Modules & Package
feature ini memungkinkan kita untuk mengatur dependency yang kita butuhkan pada project kita. 
jika kita menggunakan go module, maka kita tidak perlu lagi mengatur GOPATH, karena go module 
akan mengatur GOPATH secara otomatis. GOMODULES tidak tergantung dengan GOPATH

## Variable
* Variable declaration
    - var name string
    - var name string = "John"
    - var name = "John"
    - name := "John"

* Variable scope
    - Can't redeclare variables, but can shadow them
    - All variables must be used
    - Visibility
        - lower case first letter for package scope
        - upper case first letter to export
        - no private scope
    - Naming conventions
        - Pascal or camelCase
            - Capitalize acronyms (HTTP, URL)
        - As short as reasonable
            - longer names for longer lives
    - Type conversions
        - destinationType(variable)
        - use strconv package for strings
